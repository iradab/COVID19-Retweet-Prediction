# COVID19-Retweet-Prediction

This project was a final project for Machine Learning (2020-2021) course at Ecole Polytechnique de Paris. The aim was to reach best results in the [COVID19 Retweet Prediction Challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/c/covid19-retweet-prediction-challenge-2020/overview).


## Description of the project
For this challenge, the mission was to accurately predict the number of retweets a tweet will get. The provided dataset is a small subset that was extracted from the COVID19 Twitter dataset that was collect by the DaSciM team during the first wave of lockdowns (March 2020). It contains tweet related information, as the text and the number of hashtags, mentions and URLs contained in the tweet, and user related information as the number of followers and tweet that he has published.

The aim of competition was to reach the minimum Mean Absolute Error (MAE) .


## Results 

The final solution which had lead to best results could be found in the [Final.ipynb](https://github.com/iradab/COVID19-Retweet-Prediction/blob/main/Final.ipynb)
